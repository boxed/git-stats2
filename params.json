{"name":"Git-stats2","tagline":"Statistics for git repos","body":"# git-stats2\r\n\r\nGenerate nice graphs of statistics from a git repository. The name is to make it clear that I aim to have a good replacement for GitStats (http://gitstats.sourceforge.net).\r\n\r\nDifferences from GitStats:\r\n\r\n- I've removed stats that are uninteresting (changes per week, per month, etc)\r\n- Much faster (~100 seconds for django on my laptop, vs ~300 for GitStats)\r\n- Prettier output with JS-based interactive charts (with more than say 5 contributors this makes the output a lot more usable)\r\n- Partial updates (cache old collected data and then rerun to update the statistics with the new changes since the last run)\r\n- Features to clean up the data:\r\n  - Aliases for different emails used by the same person\r\n  - Avoids commits that looks like embedded libs or other batch updates\r\n  - Blacklist/whitelist of commits to include or exclude in the collection\r\n  \r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```\r\nbrew install libgit2\r\npip install pygit2\r\npython git_stats2.py <repo>\r\nopen graph.html\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
